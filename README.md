# Code_Review_Redux

Instructions: Welcome to Code_Review_Redux!

  Upon arriving on the website, the user will be asked to either Sign up or simply login if it is a previous user.

  After signing up or logging in, the user will notice six current categories on the left side.  When you click on a category, that specific category will animate to the Q & A section to the right. Each category has a set number of questions and answers that is stored in the JSON file and then called for it to display one question at a time

  Once a question has been displayed, the user then will left click on the card to flip back and forth between the answer and question to that specific question. Then there are two categories at the bottom of the flashcards.  If the user understands or knew the answer to the flash card without having to look at the answer, the user can choose "I understand this, yay!".  However, if the user did not understand the card, they will choose the "I'll review this again..." option.  

  The user will notice that depending on the category chosen, there is a prompt that tells the user how many cards are left in the stack. If the user has clicked on the "I'll review this again..." option, that specific card will be stored for the user to revisit before completing the category.

  When the user is done, they can click on the logout button.
